# For library users

If you are using a library that is built with Nitro, all you need to do is install the Nitro Modules core package:

```sh
npm i react-native-nitro-modules
cd ios && pod install
```

Nitro Modules are lightweight, yet powerful native bindings to native code, so thank the library author for choosing Nitro to make your app faster! ðŸ˜„
